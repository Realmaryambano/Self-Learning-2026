# selflearning2026

## 📘 Overview
This repository represents my **self-learning journey for the year 2026**.  
It is a structured space where I practice daily, experiment with code, and document progress through consistent hands-on work.

The repository is designed to grow naturally as my learning progresses, while keeping everything organized and easy to revisit.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Practice coding regularly
- Build strong fundamentals through daily work
- Maintain a clear record of learning progress
- Develop consistency and discipline in learning

```
Each day folder contains all the files created or used on that specific day, including:

- Practice code  
- Exercises  
- Experiments  
- Notes (if applicable)

## 📌 Current Focus
At present, the repository mainly contains **Python-based learning**, organized on a day-by-day basis to ensure steady and trackable progress.

## 🧠 Learning Method
- Learn daily in small, manageable steps  
- Focus more on practical implementation than theory  
- Write simple and understandable code  
- Improve gradually through repetition and revision  

## 🗂 Organization Principles
- Learning is tracked day-wise  
- Files are grouped logically by topic  
- The structure remains flexible to adapt as learning evolves  
- Larger sections may include their own README files when needed  

## 📈 Progress Tracking
Progress is evaluated based on:
- Daily consistency  
- Code clarity and improvement over time  
- Ability to understand and revisit previous work  

## ⚠️ Note
This repository is intended for learning and practice:
- Code may not always be optimized  
- Errors and revisions are part of the learning process  
- Improvements may be made as understanding deepens  

## ✨ Motivation
> Consistent effort every day builds meaningful progress over time.
