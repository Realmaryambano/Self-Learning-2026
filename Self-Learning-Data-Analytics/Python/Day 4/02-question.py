# Write a Python function called analyze_sentence(sentence) that does the following:
# Takes a string sentence as input.
# Converts the sentence to lowercase and splits it into words.
# Stores all words in a list.
# Creates a set of unique words.
# Creates a dictionary where:
# key = word
# value = number of times the word appears in the sentence
# Creates a tuple of all words that appear more than once, sorted alphabetically.
# Uses loops to build the dictionary (do NOT use .count()).
# Returns three things:
# the list of words
# the dictionary of word counts
# the tuple of repeated words

# Example Input
# sentence = "Python is fun and Python is powerful"

# Expected Output (format can vary)
# (
#  ['python', 'is', 'fun', 'and', 'python', 'is', 'powerful'],
#  {'python': 2, 'is': 2, 'fun': 1, 'and': 1, 'powerful': 1},
#  ('is', 'python')
# )


# 💡 Rules

# Use at least one function
# Use for loops
# Use string methods
# No external libraries
